This is a 2D Game with GPU based rendering (OpenGL3/GLSL).
Will focus on engine framework (rendering) first. Things I expect :

* Large number of units on screen
* Zoomable map
* Dynamic lighting (with faked shadow casting)
* 2.5D with fake height

Linux version only for now. But Windows will follow shortly.
