Byte-Project : TODO File
=========================

+ Context/Window
+ Inputs/Events
+ Renderer with data managment
+ Textures
+ Basic VBO/VAO meshes (sprites)
+ Scene structure
+ Camera
+ Automatic Resource loading (from files)
+ Entity 
+ Font rendering (Freetype)
+ Object Depth
+ Fix font rendering when resizing window!
+ Config file
+ Game 'class' containing : the device, the world, the scene, game states
+ Remove DEVICE and put its stuff in GAME
+ make camera zoom following fixed step zoom levels

    Animation System
    -----------------
    + Basic system (load anims as frames on a texture atlas)
    - Linear movement between tiles (ie. during walk anim)

    Map System
    ----------
    + Squared tiles map (3d?)
    + Mouse picking support
    - Procedurally created map (world-map and scene-map)
    + Pathfinding
        + basic A* pathfinding
        - wall (between tiles) collision
        - actors collision (even in-route)
        - actors movement prediction
        - group movement (squad with leader; with flocking?)
    + World-Tiles -- Scene-Tiles system
    + Scene-Tiles as a concatenation of a 3x3 world-tiles(for pathfinding)
    + Transition between world tiles during pathfinding
    - Recreation of the Scene Tile when the player move to another tile

    Scene Managment
    ---------------
    - Quad-Tree 
    - Back-to-front sorting of sprites (use depth instead?)

    Lighting
    --------
    + Point-lights 
        + Map isometric fragment lighting
        + Sprites fragment lighting
        + Sprites lighting with sprite height support
    + Multiple scene lights
    - Directional (sun) lights
    - 2D Normal maps of sprites ?
    - Dynamic shadows (only walls?)

    Gameplay
    --------
    - Handling events/inputs (if GUI says so)
    ...

    Misc
    ----
    + Clean the main
    - Lua integration as a scripting language (??)
    - GUI (with Lua or json) (Handled by Beulard)
